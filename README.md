# F1 Results Viewer

A lightweight application using the wonderful [Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/) to view historic F1 results, from the current season, all the way back to Silverstone 1950.

Seriously, huge thanks to the guys at Ergast, go check them out if you're interested, they have quite a significant amount of additional F1 data that I did not use in this application.

## Disclaimer

I do not own any of the data displayed in the application, that's all obtained from Ergast Developer API as mentioned above.

I am a fan of F1 and produced this application for personal use so that I can view historic F1 race results.
